    "In brief, Jupter Notebooks are human-readable documents which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc). They use an interactive python (iPython) kernel to interact with a shell and run code. For historical reference, they were formally called iPython Notebook.\n",
